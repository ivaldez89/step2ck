  // Getting Started
  {
    category: 'Getting Started',
    question: 'What is TribeWellMD?',
    answer: 'TribeWellMD is a comprehensive study platform designed specifically for medical students. We combine AI-powered flashcards, spaced repetition, interactive case studies, and wellness resources to help you succeed in your medical education journey while maintaining your well-being.',

    answer: 'Yes! TribeWellMD offers a free tier with access to core study tools, flashcard creation, and basic features. We also offer premium features for enhanced study experiences. Our mission is to make medical education accessible to all students.',
  },
  {
    category: 'Getting Started',
    question: 'How do I create an account?',
    answer: 'You can start using TribeWellMD immediately without creating an account - your study progress is saved locally in your browser. For features like syncing across devices, joining Tribes, and tracking long-term progress, you can create an account using your email.',
  },

    category: 'Getting Started',
    question: 'Can I use TribeWellMD on my phone or tablet?',

  },

  // Study Tools
  {
    category: 'Study Tools',
    question: 'How does the spaced repetition system work?',
    answer: 'Our spaced repetition algorithm (similar to Anki) schedules card reviews based on how well you know each card. Cards you struggle with appear more frequently, while mastered cards are shown less often. This scientifically-proven method optimizes long-term retention and reduces study time.',
  },
  {
    category: 'Study Tools',
    question: 'Can I create my own flashcards?',
    answer: 'Yes! You can create custom flashcards manually or use our AI-powered generator to create cards from your notes, textbook content, or specific topics. The AI generator supports multiple question formats including multiple choice, true/false, and open-ended questions.',
  },
  {
    category: 'Study Tools',
    question: 'What are Interactive Cases?',
    answer: 'Interactive Cases are clinical scenario-based learning experiences that simulate real patient encounters. You\'ll work through patient presentations, order tests, make diagnoses, and develop treatment plans. They\'re designed to help you apply classroom knowledge to clinical reasoning.',
  },
  {
    category: 'Study Tools',
    question: 'How accurate is the AI-generated content?',
    answer: 'Our AI generates high-quality study content, but we always recommend verifying important medical information with authoritative sources like UpToDate, textbooks, or your course materials. AI-generated content should be used as a study aid, not as a primary medical reference.',
  },
  {
    category: 'Study Tools',
    question: 'Can I study offline?',
    answer: 'Yes! Once you\'ve loaded your flashcards and study materials, they\'re cached locally on your device. You can study your existing cards offline. New card generation and syncing features require an internet connection.',
  },

  // Account & Data
  {
    category: 'Account & Data',

  },
  {
    category: 'Tribes & Community',
    question: 'How do I join or create a Tribe?',
    answer: 'You can browse public Tribes in the Community section or create your own private Tribe for your study group. Invite classmates via email or shareable link. Tribes can be organized by medical school, year, specialty interest, or any other criteria.',
  },

  // Village Points & Impact
  {
