Both have hypertension controlled on lisinopril. She also has well-controlled type 2 diabetes.

**What explains this difference, and is anticoagulation appropriate for her?**`,
      back: `**Yes, she should be anticoagulated. Her neighbor likely has a lower stroke risk score.**

**CHA2DS2-VASc Comparison:**
- **Her score = 5**: Age 65-74 (+1), Female (+1), HTN (+1), DM (+1), Age ≥75 would be +2 but she's 72
  - Actually: C (0), H (1), A2 (1 for 65-74), D (1), S2 (0), V (0), A (1 for 65-74), Sc (1) = **4-5 points**
- **His score = 1-2**: Age 65 (+1), HTN (+1), Male (0), no DM

**The Decision Threshold:**
- Men: Anticoagulate if score ≥ 2
- Women: Anticoagulate if score ≥ 3 (sex adds a point but raises threshold)
- Score of 1 = "gray zone" - shared decision-making

Her neighbor may be in that gray zone or just below threshold.`,

**What change, if any, should be made to his anticoagulation regimen?**`,
      back: `**Switch from apixaban to warfarin immediately.**

**Why DOACs are contraindicated with mechanical valves:**
- RE-ALIGN trial: dabigatran caused MORE thromboembolic events and bleeding than warfarin in mechanical valve patients
- All DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) are contraindicated
- Mechanism: DOACs don't adequately prevent the specific thrombotic pathways activated by mechanical valves

**Warfarin targets for mechanical valves:**
- Mitral position: INR 2.5-3.5 (higher risk location)
- Aortic position: INR 2.0-3.0
- Add low-dose aspirin (75-100mg) in most cases

1. Mechanical heart valve

**Why is this a dangerous plan?**`,
      back: `**Non-dihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem, verapamil) are CONTRAINDICATED in HFrEF.**

**The danger:**
- Negative inotropic effect worsens systolic function
- Can precipitate cardiogenic shock in decompensated HF

**Safe rate control options in HFrEF + AFib:**
1. **IV metoprolol** (may need higher/more frequent doses)
2. **IV amiodarone** (also has rate-controlling properties)
3. **Digoxin** (if above fail; less effective but no negative inotropy)

**What four medication classes have proven mortality benefit in HFrEF, and why is the order of initiation less important than getting all four on board?**`,
      back: `**The Four Pillars of HFrEF GDMT (all reduce mortality):**

1. **ACEi/ARB/ARNI** - ARNI (sacubitril/valsartan) superior to ACEi
2. **Beta-blocker** - Only carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol
3. **MRA** (spironolactone/eplerenone) - Watch K+ and renal function
4. **SGLT2 inhibitor** - Benefit even in non-diabetics

**Why order matters less:**
- Each class reduces mortality INDEPENDENTLY (additive benefit)
- Traditional approach: ACEi → BB → MRA → SGLT2i (sequential)
- Modern approach: Start all four quickly, uptitrate together
- Getting to target doses of all four > which one you start first

**Key trials:**
- PARADIGM-HF: ARNI > ACEi
- DAPA-HF/EMPEROR-Reduced: SGLT2i benefit in HFrEF ± diabetes

**What does NOT reduce mortality:**

- Digoxin (reduces hospitalizations, not mortality)

**Reality:**
- Still calculate CHA2DS2-VASc

**The "30% Rule":**
- Creatinine can rise up to 30% in the first 1-2 weeks after ACEi/ARB initiation

**When to STOP ACEi/ARB:**
- Creatinine rises > 30% from baseline
- Potassium > 5.5 mEq/L
- Symptomatic hypotension

**Why continuing is BENEFICIAL:**
- ACEi/ARB slow CKD progression in proteinuric disease
- Long-term renoprotection outweighs short-term Cr bump
- Stopping would remove this protective effect

- Recheck creatinine and potassium in 1-2 weeks
- If stable, continue current dose

**Understanding the pathophysiology:**
- **Prerenal:** Kidneys working properly, just underperfused → hold onto sodium aggressively → low FENa
- **ATN:** Tubules damaged → can't reabsorb sodium → high FENa, high urine sodium

**The muddy brown casts clinch it:**
- Pathognomonic for ATN
- Made of sloughed tubular epithelial cells

**The Problem:**
- Last known normal: 10 PM (9 hours ago)
- Standard tPA window: 4.5 hours from last known normal
- He EXCEEDS the standard window

**BUT - Wake-up stroke protocol:**
- MRI with DWI/FLAIR can identify salvageable tissue

- "DWI-FLAIR mismatch" → can still give tPA

**Mechanical Thrombectomy: Likely candidate**

- Need to confirm LVO on CTA
- DAWN and DEFUSE-3 trials showed benefit up to 24 hours
